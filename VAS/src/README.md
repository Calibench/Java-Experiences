# Account Manager

Was mainly using this to keep track of alt accounts i was using in a game.

## How to use:

1. Enter information in.
2. Add Account (This adds it to a list).
3. Add more accounts if you want.
4. Save -> this will create a csv file and you can choose where it saves to.
5. Load -> loads in the appropriate csv file.
6. Drop down menu at the top to access different accounts.
7. Update -> pushes an update to that account.

Otherwise fairly simple gui/program.<br/>
Probably not going to update this anymore, but if i were to it would be to add a play button and autologin from the gui.
